Some configuration files and scripts for my needs of using eget.

== TODO

Rename config files from `*amd64` to `*linux_amd64`, or research how to best
organize configs concering platforms (darwin, linux, win) and architectures
(amd64, amd64).

== Why?

I tried to use `.chezmoiexternal.yaml` before, but I got lost in wanting to
achieve the perfect setup. I try to decouple downloads from dotfile management
here while still trying to manage a more complex setup in a flexible way.

What is my motivation for using eget at all?

There is always at least one application with fresh prebuilt binaries. Having
them all defined in one or a few configuration files helps me to reduce
maintenance burden.

== Considerations

=== Eget vs. AppImageUpdate

Prefer Eget since applications like Wezterm include a timestamp in the file
name which introduces additional maintenance effort.

== How do I use this? Is it standard?

It's not a standard for eget. You can use `eget_github_amd64.toml` and symlink
or copy it to `~/.config/eget.toml` after checking its contents.

You need to set `EGET_CONFIG=${HOME}/.config/eget.toml` explicitly if eget is
unable to find the configuration file.

The easiest way to use eget with an existing configuration file is
`eget --download-all`.

The other files deal with different kinds of downloads, AppImages which provide
their own updater or binaries not hosted on GitHub.

The shell scripts are a different way of using eget instead of even more
complex scripts which could do the same.

[source,bash]
----
# The pattern '^\["' relies on [global] being written without quotes and all
# packages including quotes to keep logic simple.
file="eget_github_amd64.toml"; \
eget --rate; \
echo "Number of packages: $(grep -c -e '^\["' "${file}")"; \
export EGET_CONFIG="${file}"; \
eget --download-all; \
eget --rate
----

== Priorities -- Where does it fit in?

Mostly from a Linux perspective:

. Linux distribution repositories if version is recent enough
. Flatpak / Flathub on Linux
. eget | Homebrew on MacOS | Winget on Windows
. pipx | go | rust | snap | AppImage
. container images | Wine and Proton
. VMs

== Troubleshooting

=== AppImages: error loading libfuse.so.2

Error message:

----
dlopen(): error loading libfuse.so.2

AppImages require FUSE to run.
----

On distributions like Ubuntu you can install the required package with:

----
sudo apt install libfuse2
----
